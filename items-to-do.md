# Things to do:

- look at the showEventModal() function because it's not working as expected every time; compare null title vs. populated
- add cancel or x button to the top of the create plan page
- create a bar graph of the weekly mileage totals, where each bar graph contains the percentile % of each type of training that week , color coded. There should be a button labeled "Weekly Breakdown" that opens this graph in a modal window centered in the page. Since there are only 56 weeks in a year it shouldn't be a problem to display all of them on the page. The Download button should include a zip file with a PDF of the bar graph in it.
- allow users to create a login using their Gmail account. They should be able to download features by paying a dollar each time they create a plan and want to download it.
- look into using Stripe to collect payment for downloads
- disable the reset and download button if there are no calendar events in the calendar
- remove commented out unused code
